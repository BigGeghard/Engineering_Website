We came with many ideas but we decided on a plane which did not do so well. But except that everything was good. I had a lot of fun building and seeing it all come toghther.

10/28 I had a great week. We were learning about enviromental engineering and Electrical Engineering . I also will have a game on the weekened and hopefully we win.
    
    
    
    
</p>

<p>11/4 We started to learn about circuites and how they interact and work. We went on tinkercad to start building and figuring at what happens to what. But overall i had a good week because idid good on my tests and had a great time doing it.</p>
<p>11/10 I had a spectacular week. We started working on circuits and breadboards. I was confused at first but I later got the hang of it. I had no tests this week only a couple of quizzes which i did well on. We have Friday off which is pretty nice and cool. I have yet to make plans for the weekend but I will afterschool.

<p>
    12/2 Mr. Poole arranged our class into groups. Parth, Alex
    Colin, and I are working together to make a sturdy bridge
    to support a one pound bucket. So far we have finshed the 
    prototype, this project is still in progress.

<p>
12/7 I had a great week. Me and my teamates have worked pretty hard this week in all our bridging. We worked on a freeway game on friday. We even almost won but my teamates sold.

   1/13/23 Last semester Bridge Project was amazing. Me and the group did a great job on our project. Our bridge was able to hold up high and hold for a while and carry a lot of weight. My winter break was fun me and my brother played fifa. Me and my family had a great time too. I learned about buisness during this week and worked on my buisness with my partner Austin.

   2/3 Our design will be a mouse trap.But the difference will be a three wheel moustrap car. We decided to add a longer arm to help our car have more space to go for a longer distance. Now this week we worked on it and measured our build. We made some builds and figured one that worked and built with that. Now we added our cd's which is our tires and deicided to add more wheels to the front tire.

    This week we didn't do much to our mouse trap but make a new cardboard design and add more tires.This week was a good week overal. I didn't come to school on Thursday but everything else was good i had a lot of tests and quizzes.

    10/21 This week was overall pretty fun if I do say so myself. Me and my group were building and figuring out our rocket to test on Friday. We came with many ideas but we decided on a plane which did not do so well. But except that everything was good. I had a lot of fun building and seeing it all come toghther.

10/28 I had a great week. We were learning about enviromental engineering and Electrical Engineering . I also will have a game on the weekened and hopefully we win.
    
    
    
    
</p>

<p>11/4 We started to learn about circuites and how they interact and work. We went on tinkercad to start building and figuring at what happens to what. But overall i had a good week because idid good on my tests and had a great time doing it.</p>
<p>11/10 I had a spectacular week. We started working on circuits and breadboards. I was confused at first but I later got the hang of it. I had no tests this week only a couple of quizzes which i did well on. We have Friday off which is pretty nice and cool. I have yet to make plans for the weekend but I will afterschool.

    11/18 I had an amazing and normal week. We did a lot of tests and quizzes but it was okay
    we did not do much and I had coaching to do and practices.
</p>
<p>
    12/2 Mr. Poole arranged our class into groups. Parth, Alex
    Colin, and I are working together to make a sturdy bridge
    to support a one pound bucket. So far we have finshed the 
    prototype, this project is still in progress.
</p>


<p>
12/7 I had a great week. Me and my teamates have worked pretty hard this week in all our bridging. We worked on a freeway game on friday. We even almost won but my teamates sold.     
    
    
    
</p>
<p>
    12/16 I had a great week. We worked on our bridge but this week was pretty normal/ We just studied and worked on finals and preparing for them next week.
    
    
</p>
<p>
   1/13/23 Last semester Bridge Project was amazing. Me and the group did a great job on our project. Our bridge was able to hold up high and hold for a while and carry a lot of weight. My winter break was fun me and my brother played fifa. Me and my family had a great time too. I learned about buisness during this week and worked on my buisness with my partner Austin.
   
   
    
    
</p>
<p>
   1/20/23  I learned more about buisness and offers during this week. My partner and I both presented a well project called the All Season Tires.We had a not real offer but that was fine.

   1/27 i learned a lot about chemical engineering this week. We watched and listend while Mr. Poole taught us. He talked about the different fields and how chemicals would work. My project was about the mousetrap which me and aiden will build. Next week we will start working on our mouse trap.

<p>
   2/3 Our design will be a mouse trap.But the difference will be a three wheel moustrap car. We decided to add a longer arm to help our car have more space to go for a longer distance. Now this week we worked on it and measured our build. We made some builds and figured one that worked and built with that. Now we added our cd's which is our tires and deicided to add more wheels to the front tire.

<p>
    2/10 This week we didn't do much to our mouse trap but make a new cardboard design and add more tires.This week was a good week overal. I didn't come to school on Thursday but everything else was good i had a lot of tests and quizzes.
</p>

<p>
 2/17 I worked on my project this week we only added more wheels and stablized it.Other then that this week was nothing special so It was alright.    
    
</p>
<p>
    2/24 This week we started to test our project. We made it go slowly so we can see what we should add. Turns out we needed a new axel to tie with the string and stick because our old one kept stopping. We fixed all our problems and also added a new lighter and imporved base. Im proud of our final project so I hope it will go for.
    
    
</p>


<p>
    3/3 My car did alright. It went well but the axel had problems and made it turn the wrong way into the wall. We learned that we shouldve tooken more time on designing and figuring out future and now problems. We just worked on finalizing on it this week. I also learned we needed to make our design cleaner and well built next time. Other then that this week was great and interesting.
    
</p>

<p>
    3/10 We first worked on careers and how much they pay or how they work which was interesting and I enjoyed making the slides. DUring challenge day we had a few materials and a little bit of time to make a gutter boat to work on. Our gutter boat was actully good and I think it was the only one that went the farthest.

<p>
    3/24 Over spring break I was working on myself by going to the gym everyday and working out. I would go out with my friends to eat and then the movies. I had a lot of practices and I worked on my basketball game bymyself whenever I can. This week was good we worked on designing our eggdrop and it was the best one it had a big parachute with a box with straws, sticks, and cotton balls to help support and not let it crash in the box. We had our first attempt and it worked very well. Later we were challenged to only use a parachute and no cover for the egg. It worked better then everyones group because it never broke. I was extremly happy and proud of how it worked.
</p>
<p>
   4/14 Were making a pretty normal shaped boat and we worked on perfecting the cad. We also started to cut and measure the carboard. Our thoughts are it will have to be stable and long, wide enough for Austin and I to get in togther. Other then this week was great.
